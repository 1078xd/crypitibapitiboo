    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Learn: Cryptocurrencies & Blockchain</h1>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-bottom: 24px;">
      This section provides a high-level introduction to cryptocurrencies,
      blockchain technology, and modern developments in decentralized finance.
      It is designed to help users understand the concepts behind the data
      analyzed in Crypitibapitiboo.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== -->
    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">What Is Cryptocurrency?</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9;">
      A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that uses cryptographic techniques
      to secure transactions and control the creation of new units.
      Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are typically decentralized,
      meaning they are not controlled by a central authority such as a bank or government.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-top: 12px;">
      Popular examples include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and thousands of
      alternative coins (altcoins) that serve different purposes within the ecosystem.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== -->
    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">Blockchain Technology</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9;">
      Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions
      across many independent nodes. Once data is written to the blockchain,
      it becomes extremely difficult to alter, ensuring transparency and integrity.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-top: 12px;">
      Each block contains a set of transactions and is cryptographically linked
      to the previous block, forming a secure and chronological chain.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== -->
    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">Centralized vs Decentralized Systems</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9;">
      Traditional financial systems rely on centralized intermediaries such as
      banks, exchanges, and payment processors. In contrast, decentralized systems
      allow users to interact directly through smart contracts and peer-to-peer networks.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-top: 12px;">
      Decentralization improves transparency, reduces single points of failure,
      and gives users greater control over their assets.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== -->
    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9;">
      DeFi refers to a collection of financial applications built on blockchain
      networks that operate without traditional intermediaries.
      These applications enable lending, borrowing, trading, and yield generation
      using smart contracts.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-top: 12px;">
      DeFi platforms aim to create an open and permissionless financial system
      accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== -->
    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">Layer 2 Solutions</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9;">
      As blockchain networks grow, scalability becomes a major challenge.
      Layer 2 solutions are built on top of existing blockchains to increase
      transaction throughput while reducing fees.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-top: 12px;">
      These solutions process transactions off-chain or in batches, while still
      inheriting the security of the underlying blockchain.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== -->
    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">Aztec Network & Privacy</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9;">
      The Aztec Network is a privacy-focused Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum.
      It uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable private transactions and smart contracts,
      allowing users to interact without revealing sensitive data.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-top: 12px;">
      Privacy-preserving technologies like Aztec are important for the future
      of blockchain adoption, especially in areas such as financial privacy,
      enterprise use cases, and regulatory compliance.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== -->
    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">Why Technical Analysis Matters</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9;">
      Technical analysis focuses on historical price and volume data to identify
      trends and potential market opportunities. Indicators such as moving averages,
      oscillators, and volatility bands help traders make informed decisions.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-top: 12px;">
      Crypitibapitiboo applies technical analysis across multiple timeframes
      to generate BUY, SELL, or HOLD signals for supported cryptocurrencies.
