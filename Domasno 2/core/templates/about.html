    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">About Crypitibapitiboo</h1>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-bottom: 18px;">
      <strong>Crypitibapitiboo</strong> is a web-based system designed to collect,
      process, and analyze historical cryptocurrency market data.
      The goal of the project is to transform raw exchange data into
      meaningful insights through structured pipelines and technical analysis.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-bottom: 18px;">
      The application is built entirely in <strong>Python</strong>, chosen for its
      strong ecosystem of data-processing libraries and excellent support for
      API interaction and automation. Market data is collected and stored in
      a structured format that can be easily extended to relational databases
      such as PostgreSQL.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">Why Binance?</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-bottom: 18px;">
      Multiple data sources were evaluated during development, including
      blockchain-level data, web scraping, decentralized exchanges, and
      public market-data aggregators. Each option had significant limitations
      such as complexity, instability, limited historical depth, or restrictive
      pricing models.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-bottom: 18px;">
      After careful evaluation, the <strong>Binance public API</strong> was selected
      as the primary data source. Binance provides stable, well-documented
      endpoints, long historical OHLCV data, and supports hundreds of actively
      traded USDT pairs — all without requiring authentication.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">Architecture & Data Pipeline</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9; margin-bottom: 18px;">
      Crypitibapitiboo follows a <strong>Pipe-and-Filter architecture</strong>.
      Instead of a monolithic process, the system is divided into independent
      filters, each responsible for a single task:
    </p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 20px; line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9;">
      <li>Discovering available trading pairs</li>
      <li>Defining historical time ranges</li>
      <li>Parallel data extraction using multithreading</li>
      <li>Cleaning and formatting OHLCV records</li>
      <li>Storing results in a unified dataset</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin: 30px 0 12px;">What This Project Delivers</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.9;">
      The result is an automated, scalable platform capable of producing
      up-to-date cryptocurrency datasets and performing multi-timeframe
      technical analysis. Beyond the data itself, the project demonstrates
      practical experience with data engineering patterns, API-driven systems,
      and the foundations of quantitative market analysis.
